## Automation bot slack

This is an application for automation messages sent to users, channels and groups on the Slack app. I using the SlackBots for building this bot and Google API I extract the events from the Google Calendar and customize the messages I would like to send to the Slack app. I created a function that only sends the events of the current day.
